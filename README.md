Classes - Player Classes
========================

Playable character classes, currently including human, dwarf and elf.
Besides altering the visual appearance of the character model, classes
now effect the player physics and base armor level.

Dwarf is the toughest but moves more slowly.

Elf is the quickest but is more susceptible to damage.

Human is currently unchanged.

To change class issue the chat command: /class human | dwarf | elf

To view your current class simply type /class

Changing class requires the 'class' privilege.

Default class can be set via minetest.conf, eg: classes_default_class = dwarf
